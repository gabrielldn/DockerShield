# DockerShield

## 📌 About the Project

DockerShield is a project designed to containerize a React application and scan it for vulnerabilities using **Trivy**. It also generates detailed reports on the security of the created Docker image.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements
Before getting started, make sure you have the following programs installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Trivy](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/v0.45.1/getting-started/installation/)
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## 📥 Installation

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh repo clone gabrielldn/DockerShield

# Or using Git
git clone https://github.com/gabrielldn/DockerShield.git
```
Enter the project directory:
```bash
cd DockerShield
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### 🔹 1. Build the Docker image
Use the command below to build the image:
```bash
make build
```
By default, the image will be created with the name **docker-shield**.

### 🔹 2. Scan the image
If you want to build and scan the image at once, run:
```bash
make all
```

The **build-and-scan.sh** script will prompt for the image name and tag. If vulnerabilities are found, the image will be automatically removed.

---

## 📊 Security Reports

- The reports generated by **Trivy** are stored in the `relatory/` folder.
- The **trivy_report.json** file contains details of the vulnerabilities found.
- The **SecIssues.md** file presents a summary of the vulnerabilities organized by severity.

---

## 🛑 Removal of Insecure Images
If vulnerabilities are detected, the image will be **automatically removed** to prevent misuse.
